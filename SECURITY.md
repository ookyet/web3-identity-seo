Security Policy

Please report vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisory (preferred). Do not open public issues with exploit details or include PII/secrets. This project does not accept “data scraping” or invasive tracking as security or feature proposals. The optional GSC module is read‑only, local‑cache only; submission utilities (Indexing API/IndexNow) send public URLs to search engines and handle no personal data. See PRIVACY.md for scope.
